# Introduction

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is an online IDE that integrates with code hosting platforms such
as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. With a single click it creates ready-to-use developer workspaces
with a full-featured IDE running in the cloud.

Unlike traditional cloud and desktop IDEs, Gitpod understands the context and prepares the
IDE automatically. For instance, if you are creating a Gitpod workspace from a GitHub pull request,
the IDE will open in code-review mode.

Also, Gitpod workspaces are meant to be disposable. That is, you do not need to maintain anything.
They are created when you need them, and you can forget about them when you are done. Simply go to
GitHub and create a fresh workspace whenever you need one.

The IDE is open-source and based on [Eclipse Theia](50_IDE.md). Theia is highly extensible and
builds upon mature technologies such as TypeScript, VS Code, Webpack, and Node.js.

This site provides all the details on how to use Gitpod and Theia.
