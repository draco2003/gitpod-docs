# Workspaces

A workspace is what you code in, it consists of the files, configuration and the underlying docker file. Workspace are creaated on the fly driven by
convention and configuration.

A Gitpod workspace can be created from any GitHub project, branch, issue, or pull request. Very
soon Gitpod will support additional platforms and integrate with GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jira.

In Gitpod usually have a very short life. Gitpod creates one when you need it and forget about when you are done. There is no reason to get back and do any maintainance,
because everything is driven by configuration you can always create a fresh one when you need it.
